Non-linear integral equation approach for
the boundary reconstruction in
double-connected planar domains


We consider the reconstruction of an interior curve from the given Cauchy data
of a harmonic function on the exterior boundary of the given planar domain. With
the help of Green’s function and potential theory the non-linear boundary problem is reduced to the system of non-linear boundary integral equations. The three
iterative algorithms are developed for its numerical solution. We find the Frech´et
derivatives for the corresponding operators and show unique solviability of the linearized systems. Full discretization of the systems is realized by a trigonometric
quadrature method. Due to the inherited ill-possedness in the obtained system
of linear equations we apply the Tikhonov regularization. The numerical results
show that the proposed methods give a good accuracy of reconstructions with an
economical computational cost.
